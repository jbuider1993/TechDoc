x
Same as X, except that it prints '+00' for the zone offset zero, not 'Z'.

		DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy-MM-dd['T'HH:mm:ss[ZZZ]]");
		
		String dateString = "2022-03-23T00:00:00";
		
		parseDateFromString("2019-05-31");
		parseDateFromString("2019-05-31T16:30:12");
		parseDateFromString("2022-05-31T00:00:00+04:00");
		parseDateFromString("2019-05-31Hello");

The Daylight Time scheme, which includes the Eastern Daylight time, was developed to take advantage of longer time of sunlight in the summer season. In turn, it became a method d to increase human activity and production during the longer time of daylight.

Summary:

1.Eastern Standard Time and Eastern Daylight Time are both time zones under the Eastern Time Zone. They are both included in the 21 North American time zones, 9 main United States time zones (which includes Alaska and Hawaii time zones )and the 4 standard time zone in mainland United States.
2.Both time zones are used in the same areas in the United States and Canada but in different parts of the year. Eastern Standard is used during the fall – winter season, beginning at the first Sunday of November. Eastern Standard Time is canceled at the second Sunday of March and switches into Eastern Daylight Time for the summer – spring season. The cycle begins again with Eastern Standard on the time when the first Sunday of November approach.
3.With regard to the Coordinated Universal Time, Eastern Standard is 5 hours behind while Eastern Daylight is four hours behind. Compared with each other, Eastern Standard Time is one hour behind Eastern Daylight time.
